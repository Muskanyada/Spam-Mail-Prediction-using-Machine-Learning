# 📧 Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 🌟 Overview  
Spam emails are a major challenge in today's digital world, often carrying **phishing links, scams, or malware**. This project aims to build an **efficient spam detection system** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing email content, the model classifies messages as **spam or ham (not spam)** with high accuracy.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**: Text normalization, stopword removal, and tokenization  
✅ **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization  
✅ **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - 🔹 Logistic Regression  
   - 🔹 Random Forest Classifier  
   - 🔹 Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)  
✅ **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
✅ **Data Visualization**: Insights into spam vs. ham email distribution
